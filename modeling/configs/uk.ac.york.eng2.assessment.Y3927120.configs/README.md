# Launch configurations

This project should have all the `.launch` files needed to try out your model validation and model-to-text transformations.

To create `.launch` files, see [this page](https://eclipse.dev/epsilon/doc/articles/minimal-examples/#epsilon-launch-configurations) for instructions.
